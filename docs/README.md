# PowerUp Manager

#### I'm [Victor Bosch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-b-a596a2138/) student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/cat/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Marc Garrigó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo).

##### This website is going to try to make you understand how power up's work in videogames and how to implement them into your own projects or future videogames.

## Introduction

First of all before implementing our power up manager, I'll do a brief introduction about power up's, what they are, types of them, distictions between them and good/bad examples that we can find in videogames.

### Power Up's

Any regular player, should have an idea of what are power up's, we can find a generic description about power up's and it's defined as an object that empowers the character giving him extra abilities for a period of time. This definition can be applied by most of the videogames, but we could maybe chage a bit this description, why? I'll explain it on the next point, types of power up's.

##### Types of power up's

#### Examples

Now that we have explained how power up's are, I'll make a distinction of some videogames that use power up's in a right way and the ones that do it in a wrong way.

##### Bad

##### Good
