# PowerUp Manager

#### I'm [Victor Bosch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-b-a596a2138/) student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/cat/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Marc Garrigó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo).

##### This website is going to try to make you understand how power up's work in videogames and how to implement them into your own projects or future videogames.

## Introduction

First of all before implementing our power up manager, I'll do a brief introduction about power up's, what they are, types of them, distictions between them and good/bad examples that we can find in videogames.

### Power Up's

Any regular player, should have an idea of what are power up's, we can find a generic description about power up's and it's defined as an object that empowers the character giving him extra abilities for a period of time. This definition can be applied by most of the videogames, but we could maybe chage a bit this description, why? I'll explain it on the next point, types of power up's.

##### Types of power up's

Like the definition I've quoted before, regular videogame players should know the types of power up's that can be found in videogames, but I find it usefull to remind them, maybe could be some you didn't think of.



#### Examples

Now that we have explained how power up's are, I'll make a distinction of some videogames that use power up's in a right way and the ones that do it in a wrong way.
We can distinguish the different power up's according to the ability they give.

- Offensive/Defensive power up's

They provide a boost of attack or defense to the character.

- Evasive/Access power up's

They provide a boost of the movement of the character or access to new areas.

- Health/Ammo supplies

Give the character a health/ammo boost (Max health/ammo up) or supplying him with life/ammo, Ammo can be applied as any type of resouce, like health, could be mana.

- Coin power up's

Provide the "money" resouce of the game.

These are the basic power up's in any videogame, but power up's can be whatever the designer can think of.
